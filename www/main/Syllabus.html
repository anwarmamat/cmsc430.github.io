Its major goal is to arm students with the ability to design,
implement, and extend a programming language. Throughout the course,
students will design and implement several related high-level
programming languages, building compilers that target the x86 CPU
architecture.</p><p>The course assumes familiarity with a functional programming such as
OCaml from CMSC 330, and, to a lesser extent, imperative programming
in C and Assembly as covered in CMSC 216.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Course Structure:</span> The course will consist of
in-person lectures, which will be recorded and available on ELMS
immediately after each lecture.  There are two midterms, a final
project, which counts as the final assessment for the class, several
assignments, and several quizes and surveys.  Midterms are take-home
exams and completed online over a 24 period.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Contents:</span></p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Policies_and_.Resources_for_.Undergraduate_.Courses%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">1<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Policies and Resources for Undergraduate Courses</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Course_.Guidelines%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">2<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Course Guidelines</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Office_.Hours%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">3<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Office Hours</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Topics%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">4<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Topics</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Grades%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">5<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Grades</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._syllabus-videos%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">6<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Videos</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._syllabus-assignments%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">7<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Assignments</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._syllabus-quiz%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">8<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Quizzes &amp; surveys</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._syllabus-midterms%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">9<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Midterms</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._syllabus-project%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">10<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Project</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Computing_.Resources%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">11<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Computing Resources</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Outside-of-class_communication_with_course_staff%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">12<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Outside-of-class communication with course staff</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Excused_.Absences%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">13<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Excused Absences</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Students_with_.Disabilities%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">14<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Students with Disabilities</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Academic_.Integrity%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">15<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Academic Integrity</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Course_.Evaluations%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">16<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Course Evaluations</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Right_to_.Change_.Information%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">17<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Right to Change Information</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#%28part._.Course_.Materials%29" class="toclink" data-pltdoc="x">18<span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span>Course Materials</a></p></td></tr></table><h4 class="heading">1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Policies_and_.Resources_for_.Undergraduate_.Courses)"></a>Policies and Resources for Undergraduate Courses<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._.Policies_and_.Resources_for_.Undergraduate_.Courses)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h4><p>It is our shared responsibility to know and abide by the University of

environments. We invite you, if you wish, to tell us how you want to
be referred to in this class, both in terms of your name and your

pronouns someone uses are not necessarily indicative of their gender

in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and
dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity (e.g., should it come
up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives)
and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  Course staff

please email at anwar@umd.edu. Please DO NOT email
questions that are easily found in the syllabus or on ELMS (i.e. When
is this assignment due?  How much is it worth? etc.) but please DO
reach out about personal, academic, and intellectual
concerns/questions.</p><p>ELMS: IMPORTANT announcements will be sent via ELMS messaging. You
must make sure that your email &amp; announcement notifications (including
changes in assignments and/or due dates) are enabled in ELMS so you do
not miss any messages.  You are responsible for checking your email
and Canvas/ELMS inbox with regular frequency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Communication with Peers:</span></p><p>With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves
in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is
important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner
and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom
environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate
controversial questions. We encourage you to confidently exercise your
right to free speech&#8212;bearing in mind, of course, that you will be
expected to craft and defend arguments that support your
position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course
is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory
language. We will make every reasonable attempt to create an
atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their
argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned,
or devalued.</p><p>Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially
and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere
will not be tolerated. Please alert the instructor immediately if you
feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during the
semester and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way
hindered by the learning environment.</p><h4 class="heading">3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Office_.Hours)"></a>Office Hours<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._.Office_.Hours)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h4><p>Office hours will be held online and in-person.

care professional who treated you. This documentation must verify
dates of treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was
unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain
the name and phone number of the medical service provider to be used
if verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be
requested. Note that simply being seen by a health care professional
does not constitute an excused absence; it must be clear that you were
unable to perform your academic duties.</p><p>It is the University&rsquo;s policy to provide accommodations for students
with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is the your

religious observances. If you have a conflict with one of the planned
exams, you <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> inform the instructor prior to the end of the

a makeup exam. If you might miss an exam for any other reason other

discuss the circumstances. We are not obligated to offer a substitute
assignment or to provide a makeup exam unless the failure to perform
was due to an excused absence.</p><p>The policies for excused absences <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> apply to project
assignments. Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be

following statement on each examination or assignment in every course:
"I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any
unauthorized assistance on this examination (or assignment)."
Consequently, you will be requested to include this pledge on each
exam and assignment. Please also carefully read the Office of Information
Technology&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/">policy</a>
regarding acceptable use of computer accounts.</p><p>Assignments and projects are to be completed <span style="font-weight: bold">individually</span>,
therefore cooperation with others or use of unauthorized materials on
assignment or projects is a violation of the University&rsquo;s Code of
Academic Integrity. Both the person receiving assistance <span style="font-weight: bold">and the
person providing assistance</span> are in violation of the honor
code. <span style="font-weight: bold">Any evidence</span> of this, or of unacceptable use of computer
accounts, use of unauthorized materials or cooperation on exams or
quizzes, or other possible violations of the Honor Code, <span style="font-weight: bold">will be
submitted</span> to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF
for the course, suspension, or expulsion.</p><ul><li><p>For learning the course concepts, students are welcome to study
together or to receive help from anyone else. You may discuss with
others the assignment or project requirements, the features of the
programming languages used, what was discussed in class and in the
class web forum, and general syntax errors. Examples of questions that
would be allowed are "Does a cond expression always end with an
else-clause?"  or "What does a &rsquo;mismatched parenthesis&rsquo; error
indicate?", because they convey no information about the contents of an
assignment.</p></li><li><p>When it comes to actually writing an assignment, other than help
from the instructional staff, assignments must solely and entirely be
your own work.  Working with another student or individual, or using
anyone else&rsquo;s work <span style="font-weight: bold">in any way</span> except as noted in this
paragraph, is a violation of the code of academic integrity and
<span style="font-weight: bold">will be reported</span> to the Honor Council. You may not discuss
design of any part of an assignment with anyone except the instructor
and teaching assistants. Examples of questions you may <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> ask
others might be "How did you implement this part of the assignment?"
or "Please look at my code and help me find my stupid syntax
error!". You may not use any disallowed source of information in
creating either the design or code. When writing assignment you are
free to use ideas or <span style="font-weight: bold">short fragments</span> of code from
<span style="font-weight: bold">published</span> textbooks or <span style="font-weight: bold">publicly available</span> information,
but the specific source must be cited in a comment in the relevant
section of the program. </p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Violations of the Code of Academic Integrity may include, but
are not limited to:</span></p><ul><li><p>Failing to do all or any of the work on a project by yourself,

data, to another student.</p></li><li><p>Allowing any other students access to your program on any
computer system.</p></li><li><p>Posting solutions to your projects to publicly-accessible sites,
e.g., on github.</p></li><li><p>Transferring any part of an assignment or project to or from another
student or individual by any means, electronic or otherwise.</p></li></ul><p>If you have any question about a particular situation or source then
consult with the instructors in advance. Should you have difficulty
with a programming assignment you should <span style="font-weight: bold">see the instructional
staff in office hours</span>, and not solicit help from anyone else in

requirements. Students&rsquo; academic careers have been significantly
affected by a decision to cheat. Think about whether you want to join

cheat.</p><p>You may not share, discuss, or compare assignment solutions even after
